The TopModule can be designed by directly implementing the logic gates for each output port as described in the problem statement. Since this is a combinational circuit, we do not need to worry about clock signals or sequential logic. Each output can be computed directly from the inputs a and b using the corresponding logical operation.
```

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input a,
    input b,
    output out_and,
    output out_or,
    output out_xor,
    output out_nand,
    output out_nor,
    output out_xnor,
    output out_anotb
);

assign out_and = a & b;
assign out_or = a | b;
assign out_xor = a ^ b;
assign out_nand = ~(a & b);
assign out_nor = ~(a | b);
assign out_xnor = ~(a ^ b);
assign out_anotb = a & ~b;

endmodule
