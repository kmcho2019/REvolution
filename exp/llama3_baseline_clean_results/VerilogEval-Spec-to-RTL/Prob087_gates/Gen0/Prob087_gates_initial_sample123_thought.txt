To implement the TopModule, we need to design a combinational circuit with two inputs (a and b) and seven outputs. Each output is driven by a different logical operation between inputs a and b. We can directly instantiate the logic gates for each output inside the module. The module will have no internal state, only combinatorial logic, as the outputs depend solely on the current state of the inputs.
```

```verilog
module TopModule(
    input  a,
    input  b,
    output out_and,
    output out_or,
    output out_xor,
    output out_nand,
    output out_nor,
    output out_xnor,
    output out_anotb
);

assign out_and = a & b;
assign out_or = a | b;
assign out_xor = a ^ b;
assign out_nand = ~(a & b);
assign out_nor = ~(a | b);
assign out_xnor = ~(a ^ b);
assign out_anotb = a & ~b;

endmodule
```
