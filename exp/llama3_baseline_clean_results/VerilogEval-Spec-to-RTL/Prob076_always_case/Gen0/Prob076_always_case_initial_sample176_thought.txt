To implement the 6-to-1 multiplexer, we will use a series of conditional statements to check the value of the sel input. Based on the value of sel, we will assign the corresponding data input to the out output. If sel is outside the range of 0 to 5, we will output 0. We can use Verilog's case statement to simplify the code and make it more readable.
```
```verilog
module TopModule(
    input [2:0] sel,
    input [3:0] data0,
    input [3:0] data1,
    input [3:0] data2,
    input [3:0] data3,
    input [3:0] data4,
    input [3:0] data5,
    output [3:0] out
);

    always @(*) begin
        case (sel)
            3'b000: out = data0;
            3'b001: out = data1;
            3'b010: out = data2;
            3'b011: out = data3;
            3'b100: out = data4;
            3'b101: out = data5;
            default: out = 4'b0000;
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```
