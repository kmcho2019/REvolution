To solve this problem, I will create a Verilog module named TopModule that takes a 16-bit scancode as input and outputs four 1-bit signals indicating whether the left, down, right, or up arrow key was pressed. I will use a case statement to map the scancodes to their corresponding arrow key signals. If the scancode does not match any of the arrow keys, all output signals will be set to 0.
```

```verilog
module TopModule (
    input [15:0] scancode,
    output left,
    output down,
    output right,
    output up
);

always @(scancode) begin
    case (scancode)
        16'he06b: begin
            left = 1'b1;
            down = 1'b0;
            right = 1'b0;
            up = 1'b0;
        end
        16'he072: begin
            left = 1'b0;
            down = 1'b1;
            right = 1'b0;
            up = 1'b0;
        end
        16'he074: begin
            left = 1'b0;
            down = 1'b0;
            right = 1'b1;
            up = 1'b0;
        end
        16'he075: begin
            left = 1'b0;
            down = 1'b0;
            right = 1'b0;
            up = 1'b1;
        end
        default: begin
            left = 1'b0;
            down = 1'b0;
            right = 1'b0;
            up = 1'b0;
        end
    endcase
end

endmodule
