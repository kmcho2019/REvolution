To implement the TopModule, we can use a state machine with four states corresponding to the four possible water levels. The state machine will be controlled by the 3-bit input s. Based on the current state and the previous state, we will determine the flow rate. We will use a variable to keep track of the previous state. When the reset signal is asserted, the state machine will reset to the state equivalent to the water level being low for a long time. We will also use the previous state to determine if the Supplemental flow valve should be opened.
