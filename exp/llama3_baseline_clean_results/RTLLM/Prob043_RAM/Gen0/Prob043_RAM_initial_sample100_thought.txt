```thought
The approach involves designing a Verilog module named RAM that includes two always blocks for handling write and read operations respectively. The first always block is responsible for writing data to the RAM array based on the write enable signal and address. The second always block handles reading data from the RAM array based on the read enable signal and address. The module also includes a reset mechanism to clear the RAM array and read_data register upon assertion of the active-low reset signal.
```

```verilog
module RAM(
    input clk,
    input rst_n,
    input write_en,
    input [2:0] write_addr,
    input [5:0] write_data,
    input read_en,
    input [2:0] read_addr,
    output [5:0] read_data
);

parameter WIDTH = 6;
parameter DEPTH = 8;

reg [WIDTH-1:0] RAM [DEPTH-1:0];

integer i;

always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
    if (!rst_n) begin
        for (i = 0; i < DEPTH; i++) begin
            RAM[i] <= 6'b0;
        end
    end else if (write_en) begin
        RAM[write_addr] <= write_data;
    end
end

reg [WIDTH-1:0] read_data_reg;

always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
    if (!rst_n) begin
        read_data_reg <= 6'b0;
    end else if (read_en) begin
        read_data_reg <= RAM[read_addr];
    end else begin
        read_data_reg <= 6'b0;
    end
end

assign read_data = read_data_reg;

endmodule
```
