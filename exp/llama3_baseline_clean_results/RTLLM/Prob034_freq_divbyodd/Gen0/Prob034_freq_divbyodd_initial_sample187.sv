To implement the freq_divbyodd module, we'll use a combination of counters and conditional statements to divide the input clock frequency by an odd divisor value provided as a parameter. We'll use two counters, cnt1 and cnt2, to track the rising and falling edges of the clock. Two separate clock dividers, clk_div1 and clk_div2, will be used for positive and negative edges of the clock, respectively. The final divided clock output, clk_div, will be derived by logically OR-ing clk_div1 and clk_div2 to account for both clock edges. The active low reset signal rst_n will be used to initialize the counters and the clock divider outputs.
```
```verilog
module freq_divbyodd (
    input clk,
    input rst_n,
    output reg clk_div
);

parameter NUM_DIV = 5;

reg [2:0] cnt1;
reg [2:0] cnt2;
reg clk_div1;
reg clk_div2;

always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
    if (~rst_n) begin
        cnt1 <= 0;
        cnt2 <= 0;
        clk_div1 <= 0;
        clk_div2 <= 0;
    end else if (clk) begin
        if (cnt1 == (NUM_DIV - 1) / 2) begin
            clk_div1 <= ~clk_div1;
            cnt1 <= 0;
        end else begin
            cnt1 <= cnt1 + 1;
        end
    end else begin
        if (cnt2 == (NUM_DIV - 1) / 2) begin
            clk_div2 <= ~clk_div2;
            cnt2 <= 0;
        end else begin
            cnt2 <= cnt2 + 1;
        end
    end
end

always @(posedge clk) begin
    clk_div <= clk_div1 | clk_div2;
end

endmodule
