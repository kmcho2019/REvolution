// Module TopModule implements a 2-1 multiplexer.
// It selects between two 100-bit inputs, 'a' and 'b', based on the 'sel' input.
// When 'sel' is 0, 'a' is selected; when 'sel' is 1, 'b' is selected.

module TopModule(
    // 100-bit input vectors a and b
    input  [99:0] a,  
    input  [99:0] b,  
    // 1-bit select input sel
    input  sel,       
    // 100-bit output vector out
    output [99:0] out 
);

// Use a single assign statement with a ternary operator to conditionally assign 'out' based on 'sel'.
// This approach takes advantage of Verilog's vector capabilities, simplifying the code structure while preserving functionality.
assign out = sel? b : a;

// For further optimization and scalability, consider the following:
// 1. Performance Optimization: Ensure proper synchronization and buffering of inputs if necessary.
// 2. Power Optimization: Minimize switching activity and consider power-saving techniques like clock gating.
// 3. Area Optimization: Explore alternative architectures or encoding schemes if this module is extensively replicated.
