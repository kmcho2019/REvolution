# Useful BD Push Implementation History

Unbounded journal for `useful_bd_push`. Record notable decisions, commands,
outputs, experiments, failed attempts, blockers, commits, and validation
evidence.

## Scaffold Start - 2026-06-22 KST

- Branch: `feat/journal-useful-bd-exp-20260622`.
- Scaffold directory:
  `docs/journal_features/revamp_history/20260622_010615_KST_useful_bd_push/`.
- User intent: make another broad push to find useful behavior descriptors
  that can show QD/MAP-Elites is effective for RTL netlist evolution and PPA
  optimization.
- Starting evidence: previous committed diversity bundle at
  `docs/journal_features/revamp_history/20260621_000217_KST_rtl_diversity_check/20260621_150407_UTC_compiled_results_bundle/`.
- Important user correction: the prior 10% effectiveness threshold was too
  strict as an early filter. This push should treat near-classic or small
  positive reproducible signals as worth deeper analysis.
- Scope of this commit: create goal-launch docs and technique package skeletons
  only. Do not activate `/goal` yet.

## Literature / Method Search Notes

Primary sources checked during scaffold creation:

- DeepGate3 and DeepGate4: scalable AIG/circuit representation learning with
  transformer-style or sparse graph-transformer components.
- NetTAG: text-attributed graph netlist foundation model aligned with RTL and
  layout.
- CircuitFusion: multimodal circuit representation over hardware code, graph,
  and functionality summaries.
- DeepSeq/DeepSeq2: sequential netlist learning with state/temporal behavior.
- MGVGA and DeepCell: self-supervised AIG/post-mapping netlist alignment and
  masked modeling.
- DE-HNN: directed hypergraph netlist representation for place-and-route
  prediction.
- AutoQD, AURORA, CVT-MAP-Elites, and VQ-Elites: QD mechanisms for automatic
  behavior spaces or scalable archives.

Interpretation: the next push should not only rerun raw Qwen or bounded
DeepGate3. It should try concrete surrogates and adaptations: projection heads,
cone splitting, sequential descriptors, text-attributed graphs, multimodal
representations, random-feature occupancy descriptors, and VQ/codebook archives
over stable non-PPA features.

## Technique Package Policy

Every method must write into `techniques/<technique_slug>/` and include:

- `methodology.md`: paper-style algorithm/specification;
- `artifacts_manifest.md`: run roots, commands, hashes, and tables/figures;
- `results_report.md`: measured results and tier decision;
- `figures/` and `tables/`: generated review artifacts after the method runs.

Placeholders are acceptable in the scaffold commit, but not at goal completion.

## Scaffold Expansion - User Corrections

- The minimum broad negative-map bar is now 10 current method attempts with
  real artifacts, not four.
- The acceptance bar is relaxed in the right place: a method can be useful from
  better hypervolume, passive archive coverage/QD score, Pareto-cell count,
  Pareto spread, unique front families, or valid-PPA yield even when average
  fitness is not the headline metric.
- The strict functionality guardrail remains: for the fixed compared subset and
  same evolutionary budget, a `T1` or higher method must produce at least one
  valid functional PPA candidate for every design where classic has at least
  one.
- Catastrophic validity collapse is not acceptable: a 50 percent or larger
  relative decline in functionality rate or synthesis-valid rate versus classic
  downgrades the method unless fixed before promotion.
- Added `code_organization_policy.md` so new scripts and source modules stay
  small, typed, modular, and aligned with `GUIDELINES.md`.
- Added `visualization_reporting_policy.md` so generated figures are manually
  inspected for clarity and result reports contain precise conclusions,
  limitations, and next steps.
- Added `vllm_runtime_guide.md` after auditing the scaffold and finding that it
  had only generic vLLM guidance. The new guide records known endpoint
  patterns, `/v1/models` preflight commands, the 128000-token research policy,
  smoke harnesses, live command shape, and run artifact requirements.
- Strengthened dependency policy after user clarification: repo `.venv` or uv
  lock conflicts must not stop a proposed method. Future runs should use
  per-technique/per-run isolated uv environments, source checkouts, or
  submodules as needed, with exact commands and commits captured in manifests.
- Verified the shared GPT-OSS endpoint with
  `curl --max-time 15 http://20.0.0.103:8000/v1/models`. It returned
  `openai/gpt-oss-120b` with `max_model_len=131072`, so the runtime guide now
  treats `20.0.0.103:8000` as an active live API target instead of only an
  older Auto-BD reference.
- Added six extra method packages from the literature/architecture search:
  `aurora_incremental_autoencoder_bd`, `dehnn_hypergraph_bd`,
  `masterrtl_sog_bd`, `deepcell_multiview_bd`, `mome_pareto_archive_bd`, and
  `adaptive_emitter_cvt_bd`.
