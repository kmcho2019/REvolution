# Journal Revamp Implementation History

## 2026-06-12 00:50 KST

Created the revamp scaffold for the TCAD journal-extension push.

- Branch: `feat/journal-revamp-20260612-005012-kst`.
- Base branch: `wip/journal-extension-2026`.
- Manuscript setup commit: `26c3d79264`
  (`docs(journal): add manuscript submodules`).
- Scaffold directory:
  `docs/journal_features/revamp_history/20260612_005012_KST_journal_revamp/`.
- Top-level goal spec:
  `docs/journal_features/08_journal_revamp_goal.md`.

Initial decisions captured:

- Treat `conference_submission_paper` as frozen submitted source.
- Use `journal_draft` for TCAD manuscript work.
- Treat `/workspace/.worktrees/realbench_integration_draft` as reference only.
- CVDP headline metric is functional pass rate.
- CVDP PPA, if added, is absolute-only unless a vetted reference protocol is
  introduced later.
- Final claims require 5 fixed seeds; seed 42 is debug only.
- Scheduler throughput is a required workstream, with a 25 percent wall-clock
  improvement gate on a fixed replay or bounded smoke harness.
- DeepSeek `deepseek-v4-pro` is a predeclared capability-escalation arm for
  long RealBench-style tasks. Its `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` must come from `.env` and
  must never be printed, committed, or copied into artifacts.
- A locked RealBench long-model probe must decide whether local vLLM is
  sufficient or whether final RealBench claims need a symmetric DeepSeek arm.
- Added explicit read-only links to the frozen ASP-DAC paper sources so the
  implementer can understand the original local-search, scalar-PPA,
  prompt-operator, UCB-softmax, and benchmark/result claims before rewriting
  journal methodology or experiments.
- Added a ruminations coverage audit. The plan is suitable as a starting goal
  because each major rumination now maps to a method change, evidence gate, or
  claim-narrowing rule; the main risk is scope rather than missing intent.
- Added `/workspace/baselines` as a retrospective resource for FunSearch,
  CodeEvolve, and EoH-style RTL comparisons. These archives should inform
  reviewer-facing experiment planning, but final claims require fair rerun or
  revalidation under the revamp gates.
- Added explicit implementation and git practice guardrails to the scaffold:
  canonical runner usage, scoped staging, tests/lint/typecheck expectations,
  manuscript submodule discipline, signed Conventional Commits, and secret
  hygiene.
- Added a method-evolution rule: the seven current journal-extension pillars are
  allowed to change if a new idea validates well, improves or preserves the
  quantitative gates, and creates a stronger journal narrative.

Next implementation checkpoint:

- Add links from the journal-feature index docs.
- Start benchmark capability schema and scheduler telemetry design.
